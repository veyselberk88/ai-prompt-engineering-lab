    "1. Identifies **active users** who have logged in within the last 30 days.\n",
    "2. Filters those users to find **high-value customers**, defined as the **top 20% by total spending** (across all their transactions).\n",
    "3. Returns a summary of **user preference trends** (e.g., counts or percentages of interface themes, notification settings, etc.) among those high-value users.\n",

    "Please:\n",
    "- Use proper or subqueries for clarity and efficiency\n",

    "## Scenario 3: Discussion Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. How were percentile calculations handled?\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI used the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function with `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)` to calculate the 80th percentile of total spending. This approach accurately identifies high-value users based on a continuous distribution rather than ranking users by buckets. Earlier versions suggested `NTILE`, but using `PERCENTILE_CONT` is more precise when the goal is to apply a fixed threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What approaches to date filtering were used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI correctly filtered active users using the condition `last_login_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'`. This ensures only users who have logged in within the past month are included. The use of `CURRENT_DATE` makes the query dynamic and portable. This logic was correctly implemented in the first attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How was the query optimized (CTE, subquery, etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure the query in modular steps. Each major task — filtering active users, calculating total spend, determining the percentile threshold, and selecting high-value users — was broken into its own CTE. This made the query more readable, easier to debug, and reusable for future extensions. UNION ALL was used to consolidate different preference summaries into a single output while preserving context.\n"
